# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2023.

I will particiate in the code roulette organized by the student association, so every day will be featuring a different language.

Additionally I will try to use nix flakes for all puzzles.

When using Nix you can execute the code for a given day with `nix run .#dayXX` where `XX` is the day number with leading zeroes.
